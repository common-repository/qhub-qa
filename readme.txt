Show questions from your Qhub simultaneously on your Wordpress site!

== Description ==

This plugin enables you to include questions from your Qhub (see www.Qhub.com) simultaneously on your Wordpress blog or website. Your Qhub posts are displayed on your Wordpress site as a customizable formatted list within your posts or as customisable widgets within your sidebar.

See a simple demo of the latter at : http://eventst.wpengine.com

For more in-depth documentation, see the Help.txt document included in the plugin folder.

== Installation ==

Installation of the Qhub Wordpress Plugin is straight forward and easy:

1. Upload the plugin to your plugins folder, or install through your wordpress plugin manager
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Qhub Plugin Config under the Settings tab, and enter your Qhub URL **without** the http:// (e.g. help.qhub.com)
4. You may also add the API key associated with your hub, however this is optional.
5. Inclusion of Qhub questions in the Wordptress post content is enabled by default. If you wish to only use the sidebar widget to show your Qhub questions, then turn `Include Within Post Text` off here.

Once you have installed the plugin, its features are available in one of two ways:

* By Default the plugin appends related questions at the end of post content. This can be turned off in the plugins configuration.
* Additional output is provided by use of the Wordpress widget system, allowing you to include the Qhub widget in any widget enabled theme.
